# Quiz Game
A fun and interactive quiz game using webpack. The quiz asks multiple-choice questions and give players immediate feedback on their answers. A progress bar shows how many questions the player has answered correctly, and at the end of the quiz, they will see their final score.

## Features
- Use JavaScript to load questions one by one, handle user clicks on the answers, and show whether those answers are correct or incorrect.
- Work with async/await to fetch questions from [Quiz API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) without making the page reload.
- Catch and handle errors so your quiz can gracefully tell users if something goes wrong, like missing data.
